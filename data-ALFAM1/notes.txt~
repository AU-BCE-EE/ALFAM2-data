The original file included some data from Martin Hansen that were not included in the database at the time of publication.
I removed these from ALFAM1.xlsx.
They are in the new version of the databased, in the AT file.
Martin and I referred to these as "yellow data" in correspondence.

Talked to Sven about ALFAM1
We decided that 1994 data from DIAS, which are Sven's, were in ALFAM1 (database and publication)
The yellow data at the bottom of the first database were, I think, all from Martin
I beleive these are all included in the ALFAM2 file from Martin
Sven thought that some of these data might be his

I reformatted the shift times as character data (first convert to correct date format, then copy out, then change format of cells to character, then paste in as text)

24 September 2014
SDH
Added measurement technique value of 1 to row 919
This was preventing proper pid recognition
Added measurement technique value of 2 to 1387 and 1388, 1396 1397

Replaced start times with end time from previous shift for rows: 
2364
2376
2381
They were each off by 2 minutes

Also for rows
3823 (10 min off)
3877
3829
3835 
3841
3847
3853
3859
3865
3871
These were all IGER, all same times, 10 min off

I did not change shift length values for any of these

Manually fixing DIAS data by splitting the difference of 30 minutes
rows
11 12
23 24
35 36
47 48
59 60

Fixes also for IUL/FAT
2739
2884
2890
3285
3294
3303
3312
3321
3330
Copied previous shift end time or split differences

Problem: were real numbers for shift numbers
e.g., 2.567....
Copied out, changed to text, pasted back in from Notepad++

Columns P+ in row 919 (CRPA) was blank. 
Seems like emission measurements started one hour late or something. 
I copied values from row 920. 
Plots like these will always have NA for cumulative emission, correctly
I did the same for rows 1387 and 1388 (copied from 1389)
Again, flux is missing
Same for 1396 and 1397

All IGER data with HeightWind data: rows 3544 to 5250, I multiplied by 100. Value must have been in meters (was 0.25). Now value is 25 cm.

Based on spreadsheet ALFAM 1 Swiss data.xlsx from Thomas Kupper, I:

Replaced "2" with "10" (for urine) rows 2697 2703 for manure type.

Reformatted shift start and end columns as dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm. This fixed a problem that seemed to come up in dt after editing in Excel Online. I had to edit it offline in Excel to fix.
