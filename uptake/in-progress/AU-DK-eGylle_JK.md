# File from Jesper at AU 

# 1 June 2022
Received revised version from Jesper few days ago: `ALFAM2_template_6_1_eGylle_JK_3.xlsx`.
He wrote that some data are missing (see ChangeLog and Issues sheets).

# 8 June 2022
I fixed some issues and sent question about missing data to Jesper and Johanna.
Seems I should be able to copy data from `ALFAM2_template_6_1_220524_JP_21E.xlsx`.
Waiting for answer.
