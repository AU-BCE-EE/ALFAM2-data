# JNK bLS data from eGylle

# File
`ALFAM2_template_6_1_eGylle_JK_3.xlsx`

# 1 June 2022
Received revised version from Jesper few days ago: `ALFAM2_template_6_1_eGylle_JK_3.xlsx`.
He wrote that some data are missing (see ChangeLog and Issues sheets).

# 8 June 2022
I fixed some issues and sent question about missing data to Jesper and Johanna.
Seems I should be able to copy data from `ALFAM2_template_6_1_220524_JP_21E.xlsx`.
Waiting for answer.

# 19 June 2022
During virtual meeting with JNK and JMP last week I copied/pasted data from Johanna's file.
I think this is all resolved now.

# 8 July
Johanna is checking application rate.
This file seems to have the wrong value.

# 10 August 2022
JP confirmed application rate by email today.
I corrected it in this JK file for the last plot.
