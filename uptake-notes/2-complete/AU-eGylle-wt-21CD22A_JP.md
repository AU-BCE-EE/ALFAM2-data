Fixed replicate issue in new file from JP 

# 8 July 2022 Application rate problem
JP noticed application rate problem.
Need to add her fix to my corrected file.

She also needs to confirm the application rate.
Jesper used a different value.

I also realized I need to change the wind speeds for the different exchange rates.

# 14 July 2022
Wind speeds seem OK.

JP has fixed replicate numbers.

I don't think application rate has been resolved.

# 10 August 2022
JP confirmed application rate by email today.

# 19 Dec 2022
Noticed a few issues that are not actually problems after seeing answers from JP.
Documenting here.

* Emission is kg given as NH3 (not N). Other submissions are kg N. Just inconsistent, no error in reported values (they are actually kg NH3 not N).
* Entered emission rate is from trapezoidal method, so it effectively accounts for fact that rate was measured at start of interval. So it *is* appropriate to interprete values as average over the reported intervals.
