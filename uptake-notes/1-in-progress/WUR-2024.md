Questions for Jan:

* what is stubble column in first sheet in arable? Does not match info column.
* can we get start date from some other column?
* rate is slurry application in t/ha, right?
* arable E15-F15, what is deep placement with mouldboard plough? Broadcast application?
* missing incorporation time delay

OK to merge on e.g., 1990-37?
Or nr column?

* is temp air temp and at what height?
* what contributors should be included (co-authors on Zenodo entry)
* can we get time of manure application? Week number from id column, time is decimal?

* in grass, I am not able to merge some obs by experiment. Is 2013-15.1-289 = 2013-15a-001? Is "A" the same as "a"? These have the same value for "nr".

* in grass, is NarrowBand trailing hose or shoe? In arable there is "NarrowBand (hose)" and "NarrowBand". First hose, second shoe?

* arable stubble

Working on message for Jan.

Questions:
1. Can we get application date from the data in the spreadsheets or only week number? 

2. Slurry application rate is in t/ha (metric tonnes per hectare), correct?

3. Are variables concNH4 and NH4KgHa mass of NH4 or NH4-N (i.e., TAN)? This is not so important because I already have relative emission.

4. I assume the variable temp (column H in Meteo sheet) is air temperature. Was it measured at 10 m?

5. What are the units for radiation?

6. In some cases id values did not seem to exactly match, so I dropped the last digits (1990-37-010 -> 1990-37), merged using the nr column, and also relaced .1 or .2 with a or b. Does that all seem correct? Here are some details from arable.

18:  508  1998-40-093                 TRUE        

7. Arable application/incorporation. Have I interpreted these correctly?

Column E           Column F 
method             methodDetail                      ALFAM2 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep placement     Injector                          Closed slot injection
Deep placement     Mouldboard plough                 Broadcast + deep incorporation?
                   Dyna-drive                        + Shallow incorporation
                   Direct incorporation by ridger    + Shallow incorporation
NarrowBand                                           Trailing hose?
NarrowBand (hose)                                    Trailing hose

8. Arable incorporation time. In a few cases the "methodDetail" column has the delay, but in most cases there is no information. I guess it was directly after application. Should I assume something like 1 minute?

9. Arable stubble. I assumed there was stubble present if column T (stubble) was > 0 OR column U (info) had the word "stubble", OK?

10. Grass application method. Is NarrowBand trailing shoe or trailing hose?

11. Who should I include as contributors? They will show up as authors of the database in Zenodo at least.

I sent these questions by email today.
