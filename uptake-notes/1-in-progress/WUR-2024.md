Questions for Jan:

* what is stubble column in first sheet in arable? Does not match info column.
* can we get start date from some other column?
* rate is slurry application in t/ha, right?
* arable E15-F15, what is deep placement with mouldboard plough? Broadcast application?
* missing incorporation time delay

OK to merge on e.g., 1990-37?
Or nr column?

* is temp air temp and at what height?
* what contributors should be included (co-authors on Zenodo entry)
* can we get time of manure application? Week number from id column, time is decimal?

* in grass, I am not able to merge some obs by experiment. Is 2013-15.1-289 = 2013-15a-001? Is "A" the same as "a"? These have the same value for "nr".

* in grass, is NarrowBand trailing hose or shoe? In arable there is "NarrowBand (hose)" and "NarrowBand". First hose, second shoe?

* arable stubble

Working on message for Jan.

Questions:
1. Can we get application date from the data in the spreadsheets or only week number? 

2. Slurry application rate is in t/ha (metric tonnes per hectare), correct?

3. Are variables concNH4 and NH4KgHa mass of NH4 or NH4-N (i.e., TAN)? This is not so important because I already have relative emission.

4. I assume the variable temp (column H in Meteo sheet) is air temperature. Was it measured at 10 m?

5. What are the units for radiation?

6. In some cases id values did not seem to exactly match, so I dropped the last digits (1990-37-010 -> 1990-37), merged using the nr column, and also relaced .1 or .2 with a or b. Does that all seem correct? Here are some details from arable.

# New versions and answers from Jan and Paul 21 March 2024

Hi Sasha,

Here we are.
Please find enclosed the (somewhat) reviced data.

 

Hereby also the answers to your questions in email of 7 March.

 

Best regards, Paul and Jan

 

 

1. Can we get application date from the data in the spreadsheets or only week number? 

For experiments before 1995 only the week number is known. For all other experiments the date is given in columns start/end in sheet nData columns AB and AC.

 

2. Slurry application rate is in t/ha (metric tonnes per hectare), correct?

Correct; the units are given in the Description sheet (now added) and also in the Notes in the first row (row 1, comments per cel)

 

3. Are variables concNH4 and NH4KgHa mass of NH4 or NH4-N (i.e., TAN)? This is not so important because I already have relative emission.

See Description sheet

 

4. I assume the variable temp (column H in Meteo sheet) is air temperature. Was it measured at 10 m?

See Description sheet; air temperature measured at 1.5 m

 

5. What are the units for radiation?

See Description sheet; J/cm2/h. Note that this is cumulative over the time

 

6. In some cases id values did not seem to exactly match, so I dropped the last digits (1990-37-010 -> 1990-37), merged using the nr column, and also relaced .1 or .2 with a or b. Does that all seem correct? Here are some details from arable that show which id values are in which sheets. This table has those that are not present in all 4 sheets (but the pairing is clear from the nr column).

      nr           id sheet1 sheet2 sheet3 sheet4 

 1: -547 1990-37-0010                 TRUE        

 2: -547  1990-37-010   TRUE   TRUE          TRUE 

 3:  501  1998-39-001   TRUE   TRUE          TRUE 

 4:  501  1998-39-086                 TRUE        

 5:  502  1998-39-002   TRUE   TRUE          TRUE 

 6:  502  1998-39-087                 TRUE

10:  504  1998-39-089                 TRUE        

11:  505  1998-40-001   TRUE   TRUE          TRUE 

12:  505  1998-40-090                 TRUE        

13:  506  1998-40-002   TRUE   TRUE          TRUE 

14:  506  1998-40-091                 TRUE        

15:  507  1998-40-003   TRUE   TRUE          TRUE 

16:  507  1998-40-092                 TRUE        

17:  508  1998-40-004   TRUE   TRUE          TRUE 

18:  508  1998-40-093                 TRUE        

 

Thanks for pointing this out. All IDs are now the same. We use the nr column for merging sheets.

 

 

7. Arable application/incorporation. Have I interpreted these correctly?

Deep placement     Mouldboard plough                 Broadcast + deep incorporation?

                   Dyna-drive                        + Shallow incorporation

                   Direct incorporation by ridger    + Shallow incorporation

NarrowBand                                           Trailing hose?

NarrowBand (hose)                                    Trailing hose

 

Narrow band = “trailing shoe”

Narrow band (hose)= trailing hose; Note that the band width after applying with a trailing hose may quite differ between applicators !!!

 

Mouldboard plough is a “deep” incorporation. We describe it by “deep placement” incorporation in:  Effect of application method, manure characteristics, weather and field conditions on ammonia volatilization from manure applied to arable land

Huijsmans, J. F. M., Hol, J. M. G. & Vermeulen, G. D., 2003, In: Atmospheric Environment. 37, 26, p. 3669-3680 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(03)00450-3
2.1.2. Surface incorporation

Surface incorporation was defined as the treatment by which manure was surface spread and, subsequently, incorporated into the soil. Conventional tillage implements (cultivators with rigid tines, spring tines, discs, or harrows) were used to incorporate the surface-applied manure into the topsoil directly following the surface spreading.
2.1.3. Deep placement

Deep placement was defined as the treatment by which the manure was buried in the soil, either directly by an injector or indirectly by ploughing with a mouldboard plough directly after surface spreading. The arable land injector was equipped with spring tines, which placed the manure directly underneath the soil surface at a depth of 15–20 cm. At the same time the injector carried out a tilling operation by covering the manure with soil.

 

8. Arable incorporation time. In a few cases the "methodDetail" column has the delay, but in most cases there is no information. I guess it was directly after application. Should I assume something like 1 minute?

We only had a delay in experiments 501-508  on some plots. All other experiments incorporation was carried out within a few minutes meaning direct incorporation; measurements started after incorporation. (you can not have a measuring pole in the field when incorporating that spot 😊)

(I often asked researcher about this; focusing on it that it should be mentioned…an incorporation delay really affects the emissions…see:

 
Huijsmans, J.F.M., R.M. de Mol, 1999. A Model for Ammonia Volatilization after Surface Application and Subsequent Incorporation of Manure on Arable Land. Journal of Agricultural Engineering Research, 74-1, 73-82.  https://doi.org/10.1006/jaer.1999.0438

 

 

9. Arable stubble. I assumed there was stubble present if column T (stubble) was > 0 OR column U (info) had the word "stubble", OK?

Column T gives a stubble height; when there is no number there is no stubble

 

10. Grass application method. Is NarrowBand trailing shoe or trailing hose?

Narrow band is always trailing shoe on grassland

 

11. Who should I include as contributors? They will show up as authors of the database in Zenodo at least.

Jan Huijsmans
