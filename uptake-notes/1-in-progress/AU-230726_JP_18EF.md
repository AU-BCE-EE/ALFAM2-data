Johanna sent this file along with 2 others by email on 31 July 2023.
I just got around to checking it out today.
I sent an email to her today:

```
SDH: One issue here. In "Treatments" sheet the following combination is present (row 5), but that treatment U-CM does not show up in the "Emission" sheet:
NUGA  18F   U-CM  Undigested cattle manure
Is it missing in "Emission" or should it be deleted in "Treatments"?
```

The tree U-CM treatments were wrongly named D-CM (there were six of them). This has now been fixed. Also found a mistake in the background (ppm) values. This has also been fixed in the attached sheet.
```

and sent a new version, which I am using.
