Fixed replicate issue in new file from JP 

# 8 July 2022 Application rate problem
JP noticed application rate problem.
Need to add her fix to my corrected file.

She also needs to confirm the application rate.
Jesper used a different value.

I also realized I need to change the wind speeds for the different exchange rates.

# 14 July 2022
Wind speeds seem OK.

JP has fixed replicate numbers.

I don't think application rate has been resolved.
