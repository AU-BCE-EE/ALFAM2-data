# WUR 2024 data prep
Jan Huijsmans shared data in 2 spreadsheets with their (new) in-house format.
These files are in `data-Jan`.

The scripts in `scripts` create csv files from these xlsx files, then extracts and organizes the relevant data and exports it to the csv files in `data-output`.
To run the scripts, just run `scripts/main.R` in R.

The csv files in `data-output` must be opened and data copied/pasted manually into the ALFAM2 template.
This was done to create the two files for the database `../WUR*2024.slxs`.
