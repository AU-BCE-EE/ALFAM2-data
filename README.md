# ALFAM2-data
The ALFAM2 dataset on ammonia loss from field-applied manure. This repository contains the ALFAM2 dataset and the code used to generate it from original data files. It serves two purposes: code tracking (for me) and versioning (primarily for dataset users). 

# Quick tips
* More details on the ALFAM2 project, and access to project products: www.alfam.dk.
* Want the ALFAM2 dataset? Look in "data - ALFAM2 output" for both plot- and interval-level files.
* Or the ALFAM2 database? You can download this same dataset, or some subset filtered by country, application method, or more, from the ALFAM2 database interface: https://biotransformers.shinyapps.io/ALFAM2/. 
* Looking for the ALFAM2 model R package? You want https://github.com/sashahafner/ALFAM2.
